          "title": "Learning Design Thinking: Lead Change in Your Organization",
          "description": "Design thinking is a user-centered way of solving problems. It involves extensive collaboration, using strategies such as mapping customer journeys, concept creation, and prototyping. This course teaches leaders how to help their teams adopt a design thinking mindset, and provides examples from author Turi McKinley's work at frog, a global design and strategy firm that transforms businesses at scale by creating systems of brand, product, and service. The course opens with a definition of design thinking, including the roles and spaces required for success. You will then learn how to be a good design thinking leader, with specific advice on topics from setting goals to engaging the different skill sets and personalities in the room (introverts and extroverts alike). Next, Turi dives into creative collaboration: the heart of design thinking. She covers planning, research, and concept creation, and explains how to create a \"service blueprint\" that will help make the design a reality. Chapter 4 introduces prototyping techniques to advance the design. Design thinking is all about collaboration so we've integrated a LinkedIn Group called \"Design Thinking: frog + Lynda.com course.\" Throughout the course, the author will suggest opportunities for you to share what you're learning. You'll be able to participate in course-related discussions through your web browser at https://linkedin.com/groups/7022790 or via the LinkedIn Groups app, which is available for most smartphones. This is a great way to expand your learning and get additional insights from other members taking the course.",

Join Chris Nodder as he provides a road map to his series,Â UX Design Techniques. Each technique in this series builds on the data and output from the previous techniques. The user data from observations is used to identify user pain points and create personas. The pain points and personas are used during the ideation phase to create multiple possible solutions. Scenarios and storyboards take these multiple possible solutions and narrow them down to a working set, from which you build a paper prototype that you can usability test with some more representative users.

So how should an HR professional approach the inevitable conflicts that can arise in the workplace? In this course, JoAnn Corley explains the role of an administratorâ€”enforcing policy and legal rulesâ€”as well as the need and role of an advisorâ€”coaching and viewing problems as opportunities for growth. First, get an overview of the most common employee problems and why they can present a legal risk to your company. Then learn why, as with most HR functions, problem management starts by putting a good process in place. Discover the importance of training and documentation, and find out how to circle back to the employee handbook when problems occur. JoAnn also explains how to move from the administrator to the advisor mindset by having conversations with employees and partnering with their managers to move situations forward. She shares real-life scenarios that allow you to see how to handle problems in practice, and possibly even anticipate problems before they happen.",
